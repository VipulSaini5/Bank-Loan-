üìä Bank Loan Analysis Project
Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Project repository! This project showcases my work in analyzing bank loan data using Power BI for dashboard creation and SQL for data querying. The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights that can help banks and financial institutions make better decisions regarding loan approvals and risk management.

üåü Project Overview
Power BI Dashboard: An interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics, such as loan approval rates, default rates, and trends across various demographics.
SQL Queries: A collection of SQL queries designed to answer specific business questions, ranging from loan distribution analysis to the impact of different factors on loan defaults.
üìà Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:

Loan Distribution: Visualizations showing loan distribution across customer demographics, loan types, and regions.
Key Metrics: Insights into approval rates, defaults, and loan recovery.
Filters: Interactive filters allowing users to drill down into specific segments of the data.
Explore the Power BI dashboard by downloading and opening the Bank loan.pbix file.

üìù SQL Queries
The SQL queries included in this project address the following key questions:

Loan Amount Analysis: What is the average loan amount across different customer segments?
Default Trends: How do loan defaults vary by region and loan tenure?
Risk Factors: Which factors are most strongly associated with loan defaults?
You can find all the queries in the SQLQuery2.sql file.


üßê Key Insights
Through this analysis, I have uncovered several important insights:

Insight 1: Good Loan and Bad Loan - It includes how many customers are not not paying they Principle amount or Installment on Month wise.
Insight 2: Purpose of taking loan. Why they took the loan and what they're gonna do with loan amount Such as, Wedding, Debt consolidation, Credit Card, Car, etc.
Insight 3: Term of the loan - For how long an People took loan. As in the data people usually take loan for 3 years or 5 years. Mejority are for 3 years (73%) of total loan.
These insights can guide better decision-making and risk assessment for banks and financial institutions.
